Abstraction Notes-
Hiding implementation code  from end user and provide only the functionality of that particular code
This concept is known as abstraction
- Hind the code

Properties of Abstraction
1) Abstract class contains non-abstract method as well as abstract methods
2) Non-abstract class does not contains abstract methods
3) we can not create object of abstract class because abstract contains abstract methods



Abstract methods-
Methods declaration present but method implementation (Body Of that method) is absent.
Abstract methods always start with abstract keyword.


Abstract void abstractMethod();



Non-abstract methods-
-Method declaration and method implementation both ae present.
-Non-abstract methods can start with any access modifier

public void NonAbstractMethod()
{
System.out.println("Non abstract method")
};
